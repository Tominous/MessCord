# MessCord
Facebook Messenger on Discord!

Every incoming message will create a new or find an existing text channel with the `threadID` being the name. 

When sending messages, your UserBot will delete your discod message and send the facebook message and your facebook message will show.

`npm install facebook-chat-api discord.js`

edit:

`YOUR-GUILD-ID` - Your Guild (private Guild)

`PARENT-ID` - Your text channel category (can be removed)

`TOKEN` - your bot token


Make a Bot User and invite it to your server will full permissions.

To Do:
* discord->facebook image support
